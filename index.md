Hi! I am Kunal Baweja.

I look forward to building scalable, secure and accessible technological solutions as a software engineer. I am primarily interested in working on distributed systems and infrastructure for large scale technical challenges.

Aside from computer science I am a hobbyist photographer and like to travel, exploring attractions with my lens. If it interests you please have a look at my work on [Flickr]({{site.contact.flickr}}){:target="_blank"}.

Thanks for stopping by, hope you like it here. Please feel free to get in touch !
